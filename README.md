## Project background and context
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches at a cost of 62 million dollars, while other providers charge upwards of 165 million dollars each. A significant portion of SpaceX's savings is attributed to the reuse of the first stage. 
If we can determine whether the first stage will land, we can calculate the cost of a launch. This information can be utilized if another company wants to compete with SpaceX for a rocket launch.

## Project aim
This project aims to identify a classification model that can accurately determine whether the first stage of Falcon 9 will successfully land. SpaceX data obtained from multiple sources is used to achieve this goal.
